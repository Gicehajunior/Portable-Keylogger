# Keylogger
Keylogger is a really small program which runs in background without the knowledge of owner and saves all keystrokes by the keyboard. 
It sends the log file of keystrokes to a certain email address or to a certain server. There is a "master key" which is used to access the keylogger.

Keyloggers invade PCs (and Macs, and Androids, and iPhones) in the same way that other malware does. The same Trojan that delivers the keylogger can slip other malware on your systemâ€”such as adware, spyware, ransomware, or even a legacy virus.
